## Purpose of the project
<p> (1) make fake time series data based on sin() and add anomalies to it; and (2) train a model and design a class to detect those anomalies

## time_series_anomaly_detection.ipynb
<p> where the experiment runs

## codes
<p> data.py: used to make fake data
<p> model.py: contains (1) a function used to get the model for training; and (2) a class for detecting anomalies

## models
<p> where trained models reside
